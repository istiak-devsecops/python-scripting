# Devops-oriented-python-script  
A growing collection of Python scripts for DevOps & SysAdmin automation  
(by Istiak / [istiak-devsecops](https://github.com/istiak-devsecops))

---

## Overview  
This repo is a work in progress — I regularly add new Python scripts as I learn, practice, and solve real-world DevOps challenges.  
Think of it as a living toolbox for automation: server health checks, log parsing, backups, alerts, and more.

If you’re a DevOps engineer, sysadmin, or developer managing infrastructure, you might find ready-to-use helpers here — or inspiration to build your own.

## Current Scripts  
Here are the scripts currently included (list will grow over time):

| Script name             | Purpose                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `server_health_check.py`| Check disk, memory, CPU, and uptime status                             |                      |
| …                       | More coming soon                                                        |

_(Check back often — new scripts are added regularly.)_
